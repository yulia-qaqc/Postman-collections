## Postman-collections

### 1. API testing of TMS Qase.io with Postman

Testing the "Projects" feature with the following user stories: 
- get all projects
- create new project
- get project by code
- delete project by code

Collection includes the scripts:
1. for visualization of the response;
2. for automatic creation of the variable containing data from the response body.

To run the collection in Postman you will need the token. You can download it in your personal account in Qase.io. 
Then add your token into the current value to variable "Token" and you can run the tests.
